The following descriptions are derived from how communities intuit their Macrodesire systems, e.g., the social standing, morals, and tendencies that shape their culture\u2019s acquisition:</p> <ul> <li>Binding is multifaceted. At its core, it is the setting force that changes conviction into truth. As the kernel of most Fractured Remnants, its role in our world is both as the tool to fix consequences of The Great Split, to preserve the chance for life; and, as adjudicated by empires and tyrants, the edge of the blade to enforce hierarchy. Binding is inherently juxtaposed in this way: it grants us control over spacetime, heat, entropy, physical interactions, but the most notorious use case associated with the name is violent and oppressive. The most famous example of Binding at its extreme is The Binding Stone, capable of reconstituting fate itself.</li> <li>Nullspace is the proprietor of absence. Vacuums are space without matter, but Nullspace does not permit the matter to exist; it is the boundary of space itself. It lines different Fractures like mucus, diluting and corrupting information that passes through it. Exceedingly few communities harness Nullspace in their Macrodesire systems, but we recognise just how much it influences our world.</li> <li>Irrealis is spectral. While Binding revolves around certainty and Nullspace the lack of possibility, Irrealis presents the chance for gradation within Macrodesire. To harness its power is to accept doubt and probability, to bisect between what exists and what does not, and construct the states in between. Only truly recognised as distinct since the War of Patrons, Irrealis in its purest form requires communing with the force itself. One must step into its domain and bring it forward to our material reality.</li> </ul> <p>%% -  Local: magic that extends to the wielder\u2019s surroundings.  - Itinerant: magic that travels by a (non-biological?) vector, e.g. wind, water, plant spores, etc. - Sturnus: self-iterative, potentially unlimited scope %%</p>","tags":["Macrodesire"]},{"location":"4%20Macrodesire/Macrodesire/#acquisition","title":"Acquisition","text":"<p>Just as Macrodesire usage varies across cultures, so too does its acquisition.

However, teaching is a misnomer; acquiring Macrodesire is an internal process, self-contained and instinctual. Teachers can correct posture or pronunciation (or however the community uses their system), but the child must learn the muscle memory and feeling of using Macrodesire. There is an internal logic to decipher.</p> <p>Polarity has little effect on the \u2018difficulty\u2019 of acquisition. A Binding-majority system will tend towards absolute control, and therefore focus on command in lessons; Irrealis-heavy systems, rare as they are, look more towards communication and clarity.

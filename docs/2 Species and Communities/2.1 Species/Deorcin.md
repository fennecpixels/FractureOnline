**Deorcin** (*sing*.: deor; *[Coastal](Coastal.md)*: Δεορ, *pl*: Δεορκιν) are the descendents of [Snow Elves](Snow%20Elves.md) found across $\mathbb{F}_{2}$. Oral tradition suggests their transformation was a reaction to the new challenges following [The Great Split](The%20Great%20Split.md): to survive, they chose to mutate into various anthropomorphic forms. 

## Morphology

Phenotypical expression—i.e., which morph a deor will take—is inherited by parentage. Like stem cells, each lineage specialised to cope with the environmental requirements; now that mutation lies dead. Induction is as controversial within their population as their own existence is to the remnant snow elves.

Along the [Eldritch Coast](Eldritch%20Coast.md) and the [Northeastern Peaks](Northeastern%20Peaks.md) developed the Ilopex (Αλώπιξί), resembling the arctic fox; Merivi (Μεριφι), resembling snow leopards; and the Ourous (Οωροσ), resembling bears. Today, the species—an archipelago of genetics as it is—celebrates their reference populations. 

## Biology

Deorcin stand at ~170–190 cm \[5'5"–6'2"\] tall, regardless of the taken morph. Most are generally bipedal, or at least capable of walking on two legs in polite society. Census data suggests one in twenty deorcin are born preferring a quadrupedal gait. This count remains static in the east, but, fortunately, corrects itself after admission into a good quality Avrean school.

Like their ancestors, deorcin have a [Macrodesire](../../4%20Macrodesire/Macrodesire.md)–encoding organ known as [absolution](Snow%20Elves.md#Absolution). Theirs are larger, more plump with blue blood, stained with red. It beats. The eldritch organ is still, commanding.[^1]

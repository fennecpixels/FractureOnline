# Coraxi
Coraxi are one of the only native species to Fracture, their species having come to fruition before [The Great Split](The%20Great%20Split.md). They were previously an arboreal species before augmentation by [Pakaru](Pakaru), whose influence  made them abundant, until they were driven to near-extinction by [Snow Elves](Snow%20Elf.md) and the other primitive tribes after the Great Split. During the [War of Patrons](War%20of%20Patrons.md), Pakaru took [The Chimaera](The%20Chimaera) out of hibernation which led to the restoration of his species thanks to [Airve Snowblood](../1%20Characters/1.1%20Deities/Revai,%20Fracture's%20Ward.md). The majority of Coraxi now live near [Boundary's Edge](Boundary's%20Edge) in a symbiotic relationship with [Boundarywalkers](Boundarywalker).

# History
## Before the Great Split
As an arboreal species, Coraxi often lived in forests. They often used branches to stay off the woodland floor where other species would have hunted them. During this time, many Coraxi became bipedal and their markings reflected the trees in which they often lived: vertical streaks marked the fur on their face and shoulders like bark; and their antlers worked as a way to obfuscate their silhouette. 

Coraxi became very successful at hiding during lower light conditions, which led to their crepuscular lifestyle. They would find prey on the woodland floor during dusk, then pierce them with their claws and bring them up onto the branches, where one pair of hands and feet would stablilise the Cora and the remaining claws would dissect the prey. Although omnivorous, ambush hunting was one of the most successful developments for Coraxi. 

## The Formative Years after the Great Split

The Great Split caused many new species to find refuge within the Coraxi forests, including Elves, Orcs, and Humans. Whereas the others were disorientated, Coraxi were habituated to their environment, which had remained the same despite Fracture. [Pakaru](Pakaru) recognised their potential power and decided to augment their species.

For the Coraxi, augmentation by Pakaru led to sentience. Their species quickly outgrew their branches and started to walk on the floor itself—their place in the food chain was now as apex. Although once nomadic, Pakaru reformed their species into a communal one, where a language artificially formed thanks to the deity’s influence. 

Pakaru wanted the Coraxi to act as a guide for the new species. They would scout out caves and copses where human primitive shelters would survive well, lead the confused individuals to each location, and let Pakaru’s influence prompt them into saving themselves. As one of the first species ‘employed’ by Pakaru, their work was fundamental for the modern societies within Fracture.

## Early Fracture

Once the new species were settled, their increasing need for wood threatened the Coraxi forests. Some groups began to copy the primitive structures they had watched many humans build, whereas some turned to hostility. Those that copied spread out into open heathlands as an emerging tribal community; those that fought stayed in the forests and regressed into a strongly territorial force, though passive to other Coraxi. Both groups would accommodate the other when needed—the decision was seen as one of survival for the entire species, not just the individual. 

As the new species—a name which stuck with the elves, orcs, and  humans—developed their technology rapidly, tribal Coraxi were often the target of hunts due to their size. One Cora could feed a family for up to six months. Some humans tried to eat Coraxi regularly, but domestication repeatedly failed; humans didn’t know nor care that their food was as intelligent as themselves. This ignorance meant that many humans raided the tribal Coraxi, who they thought were the same as those that defended the forest. The population never recovered from this war.

Numbers dropped almost exponentially, and Coraxi faced a serious threat of extinction. Territorial Coraxi lost their war and settled in the last few communities. Eventually, only one tribe remained—no longer needed as food, many hoped that humans would want to protect the species that helped them. The final assault on the last tribe was not led by humans, but by Snow Elves—the emerging Snowblood family, who saw the Coraxi as a species to fight for sport, would attack in the dusk. 

All Coraxi died in this fight but one. [The Chimaera](The%20Chimaera) would be taken prisoner by the Snowbloods as a trophy of their victory: he was imprisoned and neglected in an outpost by the same forests his family defended. Pakaru, recognising him as the last of his species, suspended the Cora in limbo, so that he may return when it would be safe.

## The [War of Patrons](War%20of%20Patrons.md)
As the Dragonkin emerged, it was very clear that they were weaker in terms of martial power. [Pakaru](Pakaru) recalled [The Chimaera](The%20Chimaera) and sent [Airve Snowblood](../1%20Characters/1.1%20Deities/Revai,%20Fracture's%20Ward.md) to recruit him: the Chimaera agreed to help the Dragonkin on the condition that both could kill the final Snowblood monarchs—notably [Ændren Snowblood](%C3%86ndren%20Snowblood.md). 

After Airve’s capture, the Chimaera accompanied him in returning to the final assault. The two, in collaboration with [Sæval Crasys](S%C3%A6val%20Crasys.md), defended the tribe successfully. After a vote, the Coraxi decided to follow Airve and the Chimaera back to the future where it would be safer—no notable records of the Coraxi survived the Snowblood rule. 

## A World post-Binding

After the distruction of the Binding Stone, the majority of the now-much-larger Coraxi population lived in the far west, where [Boundary's Edge](Boundary's%20Edge) would later form. Airve and the Chimaera studied the [The Binding Stone](The%20Binding%20Stone)’s remnants, the key to [Irrealis](Irrealis.md), which—during the fights against [M. Dubois](M.%20Dubois.md)—unlocked [Mutability](Mutability), a power which replaced [Pakaru’s Augmentation](Pakaru%E2%80%99s%20Augmentation.md)[^1].

[^1]: Pakaru’s Augmentation comprised of two parts: the species had undergone significant biological changes, such as growing significantly taller; but Pakaru also let them use his tendrils during their employment. This power was lost when Pakaru recalled the Chimaera, who himself did not call upon Pakaru very often.

# Physiology

Coraxi are tall, bipedal creatures. They have two sets of hands: their major set resembles that of humanoids, and their minor set has sharp claws used for hunting and piercing. As previously arboreal creatures, the fur on their shoulders and face continues to resemble tree bark; the rest of a Cora body has shorter fur to keep their body insulated.

Coraxi are tall, bipedal creatures with two sets of arms. The major set resembles that of humanoids, with poseable thumbs for general use; the minor set has sharp claws used for hunting and defence. 

As previously arboreal creatures, their markings resemble tree bark. This is most notable on the fur on their shoulders and face, the former of which is significantly longer than their body fur. Their antlers also help the Coraxi to camouflage themselves high-up in the trees. 

Thanks to [Pakaru’s Augmentation](Pakaru%E2%80%99s%20Augmentation.md), Coraxi can live for a very long time. Tribal Coraxi tend to live longer due to their more passive nature, but a skilled territorial Cora can take care of themselves for equally long.

# Behaviour
Coraxi are omnivorous. In the trees, they tend to hunt through ambushes and eat their food on the branches. However, as the Coraxi became settlers, their diet included more foraged goods and domesticated animals.

# Culture

Coraxi still live in relatively poor conditions in comparison to their life before extinction. Whilst they still rebuild their society, many value collaboration and a strong work ethic—especially the tribal Coraxi.

The Coraxi’s biggest settlement, [Boundary's Edge](Boundary's%20Edge), hosts a local market.

## Tribal vs Territorial Coraxi
**Tribal Coraxi** refers to those that build settlements. They are more close-knit and collaborative than territorial Coraxi, and are often considered to be too passive. **Territorial Coraxi**, those who defended the trees, are more solitary and pragmatic. They can be blunt and hostile, but very strong. 

Deciding to be tribal or territorial is a key moment in a Cora’s life: the decision is often made once a Cora has their own agency—there is no fixed time for this, but tribal Coraxi seem to take longer. There are more *territorial→tribal* conversions than the other way round, especially as tribes become safer and territory dwindles.

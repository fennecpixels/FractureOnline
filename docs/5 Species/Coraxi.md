The Coraxi are a species native to Fracture, whose population has since been been displaced. Once an arboreal species, the Coraxi were augmented by [Pakaru](../1%20Sentient/1.1%20Deities/Pakaru.md) in order to immediately help the new species to survive; however, their peace quickly turned to war and the Coraxi were thought to be extinct. During the [War of Patrons](War%20of%20Patrons.md), [Naira, the Chimæra](Naira,%20the%20Chim%C3%A6ra.md) was unearthed by the [Dragonkin](Dragonkin.md) and the process of their reintroduction began.

Today, most Coraxi take refuge in their original forestry at [Boundary’s Edge](Boundary%E2%80%99s%20Edge.md). Their culture permits a modest but satisfying communal living dynamic, although one that is very closed off from visitors. 

## Biology
To an unaware passer-by, the Coraxi appear somewhat cervine, though their anatomy has notable distinctions from this family. The most obvious of these is their bipedal conformation, secondary set of limbs, and talons. 

An average Cora stands at 190–250 cm \[6'2"–8'2"\] tall. Their bodies are almost fully covered in fur, which is longest around the shoulders, muzzle, and upper leg regions, whilst their minor limbs and lower legs have none. Most notably, their faces have long, flat muzzles which curve into their rounded browbone and extruded mandibles, creating a recession for their eyes. Their ears protude backwards with a slight outer tilt by the end—both to maximise hearing range and to avoid their antlers.

The colour of Coraxi fur is vital to their survival. Their markings resemble tree bark, which helps for them to blend into their environment; this is further aided by their antlers, which break up their silhouette and allude to branches. As such, the specific markings, colours, and antler patterns change regionally to fit in with the local trees.

### Bipedalism
Even before their Augmentation, the Coraxi were bipedal. Their legs are digitigrade, though with extended flexibility that allows both sections of their legs to rest comfortably in parallel. This extra manoeuvrability is vital for their ambush hunting, as they may jump very far with little run up.

Furthermore, their talons provide an excellent grip to tree bark. With two toes at both the front and back, they are able to walk comfortably; especially given that their talons may partially retract, and that their feet roughen with age. They are overall suited for both arboreal and terrestrial life.

### Major and Minor Limbs
Another major differentiation from other cervines is their extra set of limbs. Traditionally, the Coraxi relied on their minor set—their claws—for hunting, defence, and intraspecies competition. Their major shoulders, like humans, lie just under their neck, while the minor shoulders are just under the lower ribs. 

Their minor arms are extremely optimised for piercing. The shoulder and upper minor arm are relatively thicker than the forearms, but also soft; in contrast, their lower portion has very thin, rough skin, which is typically darker than the rest of the body. These limbs, while weak to lateral stress, can support landings with a direct local impact.  

Their major arms are much more humanoid. They have a strong grip with larger muscles than humans in the upper arm, which help with swinging from the canopy. Their hands are somewhat different than humans’, in that they only have four digits: the two central fingers are larger, while the outer two thumbs are smaller, but with a larger span. These helped the Coraxi to grip onto an upper tree branch.

### [Pakaru’s Augmentation](Pakaru%E2%80%99s%20Augmentation.md)
When Pakaru enlisted the help of the Coraxi after [The Great Split](The%20Great%20Split.md), their species developed into what we see today. Most notably this includes their sentience, and thus their language acquisition; their taller height; and enhanced strength. Furthermore, their augmentation changed their place in local food chains—the Coraxi could safely walk on the floor without the fear of getting attacked.

These developments led to the promincence of **tribal Coraxi**, now able to create long term settlements. The cooperative nature of those who followed this cause left the **territorial Coraxi** as a more ruthless and predatorial culture within the collective community. Both subcultures were necessary to help the new species—the former revitalising former community structures and the latter more interested in defence.

### Nutrition
The Coraxi are omnivorous, both foraging and hunting through ambush. Their diet is incredibly varied. 

## Culture 

The Coraxi of the modern era seek to rebuild what they lost during the war. They have reclaimed and regrown their old forestry areas—known as [Boundary's Edge](Boundary's%20Edge.md)—where they have built a hybrid tribal and territorial society in the trees. Few choose to leave until their population is more stable. 

As a consequence of their low population, Boundary’s Edge relies on scavenging to gain enough building materials. This has led to disputes with nearby settlements.

### Reproduction
Culturally, reproduction depends on territorial or tribal backgrounds. For tribal Coraxi, children are generally raised communally, though residing with their parents.  Calfs learn in group schools 

## History

### The Great Split
The Coraxi evolved alongside Fracture’s native ecosystem, though their place within it was low. They lived in the trees and camouflagued themselves out of necessity, foraging on the forest floor as little as possible. 

Whereas the new species watched their worlds slowly deteriorate, the effects of [The Great Split](The%20Great%20Split.md) were instant for the Coraxi. The sudden influx of people demanded food, shelter, and protection; because of this, Pakaru offered [Augmentation](Pakaru%E2%80%99s%20Augmentation.md) to their species. In exchange for helping the new arrivals, the Coraxi became truly sentient with accelerated language skills; growing taller and stronger as they carried refugees into safe caves; and perhaps most importantly, able to wield Pakaru’s power against predators, even if only temporarily. The fate of the Coraxi was forever changed—but not for the better.

When the new species had rebuilt their societies, they did not thank their protectors. Competition ensued, particularly for lumber. The loss of their habitats led to a cultural divide within the population: the *territorial* Coraxi defended the dwindling forest and woodland space, whereas the *tribal* Coraxi adjusted their way of life to fit the new circumstances. These tactics saw little success. In defending their homeland, the Coraxi were seen as aggressive and fake—they had no reputation as protectors. Eventually, the [Snowblood](Snowblood.md) family began their assault.

Hunting the Coraxi was a useful sport. One Cora could feed a family for a long time, and food was still in short supply; the warmongers were riled up enough by those that defended their homes; and such weaponry and tools were already itching to be used. The genocide decimated Coraxi culture until only one tribe remained.

Refugees from across many different fallen forests gathered in this final tribe. They hid for a few months, but Snowblood scouts found them and led the final hunting party.

The Snowbloods killed every Cora but one. [Naira, the Chimæra](Naira,%20the%20Chim%C3%A6ra.md) was taken into a holding cell and left to die. In one final act, Pakaru induced Naira into a coma and killed the guards. 

### The War of Patrons
Helping the [Dragonkin](Dragonkin.md), Pakaru released Naira shortly before [M. Dubois](M.%20Dubois.md) took power in [Santarri](Santarri.md). [Airve Snowblood](../1%20Sentient/1.2%20People/Airve%20Snowblood.md) met with Naira and struck a deal: he would ally with the Dragonkin as long as he could kill the last Snowblood noble—[Ændren Snowblood](%C3%86ndren%20Snowblood.md)—alongside Airve. 

Their relationship is noted to have been closer than a mere alliance. 

With the help of [The Binding Stone](The%20Binding%20Stone.md), the two travelled back to the hunt against the Coraxi and evacuated as many as possible back to the modern day.

A GUIDE TO SANTARRI & GREATER SANTARRI

FIRST PUBLISHED 15 ILUBYA, 6250 BY SANCTUARY UNIVERSITY PUBLICATION

---

## Preface

Welcome to Santarri! Whether you’re a new traveller from [London](London.md), Western $\mathbb{F}_{2}$, or elsewhere, we hope you enjoy your time in the region. This guide serves two purposes: first, an overview of our culture and customs; second, as a signpost for the crucial information. 

For those who do hail from other [Fractures](Fracture.md), our days and seasons may differ greatly to your own. We also have high rates of migration variance in $\mathbb{F}_{1}$, so take extra care with any timekeeping and plans.

## Navigation

$\mathbb{F}_{2}$ may be a small Fracture, but it is densely populated! Our main anchor ports are in the major cities of the east: [Santarri](Santarri.md) (where this guide is being written), [Avre](Avre.md), [Respite](Respite.md),  and [Soteria](Soteria.md). As you trail north along this coast, you’ll eventually reach the magnificent [Northeastern Peaks](Northeastern%20Peaks.md)—an uninhabited vast mountain range that pierces the sky. 

If you’re visiting for tourism, there’s plenty of canals and roads that can take you across the entire coast. Make sure you’re aware of [timekeeping conversions](./The%20Calendar%20Year.md) for your travel and avoid unfavourable seasons.

Western $\mathbb{F}_{2}$ is unfortunately more volatile, and few settlements can sustain themselves the further west one goes. It’s perfectly safe to tour the ruined [bastions](Bastion.md), but we recommend you hire a local guide for assurance. Upon arrival, the tourism board has a list of accredited experts for you to choose from, if you haven’t already. Most of all, we ask you keep clear of [Pakaru’s Forest](Pakaru%E2%80%99s%20Forest.md), [Ascension](Ascension.md), and [Boundary's Edge](Boundary's%20Edge.md): these areas are not guaranteed to be safe for you.[^1] 

## Species

$\mathbb{F}_{2}$ is populated by many species from a range of homelands. We first arrived here after [The Great Split](The%20Great%20Split.md), a series of catastrophes that each brought ruin to our homeworlds; our history is wrought with fighting, rivalry, and hatred, but now we stand at a new age of peace and cooperation. We acknowledge the generosity of countless benefactors, across all our species, who strove for mutual aid in their own time. We endeavour to remember the scars and, too, how they healed.

**The [Coraxi](../2%20Species%20and%20Communities/2.1%20Species/Coraxi.md)** play a particularly important role in our city. They were uplifted to protect the three new species, betrayed when no longer needed, and now resurrected by [Airve Snowblood](Airve%20Snowblood.md). As curious as they are wary, the Coraxi have been looking to define their culture on their own terms, in their own city in the west. In terms of appearance, a Cora stands tall at over 2m on average, with long antlers, two sets of arms, talons, and bifurcating mandibles. More recently, the keener Coraxi have moved into Santarri especially, with several exchange students attending the University of Santarri each year!

## Macrodesire

*Full article: see [Macrodesire](../4%20Macrodesire/Macrodesire.md)*.

While Macrodesire runs latent in all Fractures, our cultures particularly involve Macrodesire as an everyday method of interaction, almost as common as breathing. 

Each culture has its own interpretation and system. We compare these by polarity—how closely they lie to each theoretical extreme. Santarri has historically embraced Binding systems; the discovery of Irrealis has greatly diversified our perspectives. 

Of course, this is a very anthropological perspective on Macrodesire. Our Fracture survives because it wishes to: it has its own use for Macrodesire, and at its most saturated levels this can be volatile. **If you are completely new to Macrodesire, we strongly recommend you avoid regions further west.** Consult local guides on how to spot disturbances, when and where is safest, and what to do in the event of a rupture.

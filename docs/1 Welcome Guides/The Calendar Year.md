Welcome, new visitors! We hope you enjoy your time in Santarri and beyond. 

You’ll first notice that our Fracture is very different to your own. Don’t fret! This guidebook will give you an overview of the major differences you may encounter. It may be disorienting at first, but we assure you that adjusting to the cultural differences between London and Santarri is simple enough with time.

This chapter will explore how our calendar works. For the full list of explanations, please see [A Guide to Santarri](./A%20Guide%20to%20Santarri.md).

## Days of the Week

Our days of the week are very similar to your own, except we have 6 days per week. In order, they are *Nafuri*, *Seredi*, *Raidi*, *Vulpedi*, *Exidawn*, and *Geredi*. Take note of Raidi, which is said with three syllables \[ɹaɪ.ə.di\]. 

In your time, weekends were a product of religious and occupational influences. This is not the case for us. Each area will have its own partition: here in Santarri, we tend not to work on Exidawn and Geredi, though there’s always someone bustling about in the city!

## Seasons and Months

In this Fracture, we divide our year[^1] into six seasons. 

Most of these are intuitive for Londoners: we have a spring, summer, autumn, and winter. The two remaining seasons are a pre-spring budding season and a post-winter mist season. 

We welcome visitors year-round, but our most popular time of year is in Mola, when the first flowers in the city parks bloom. You can also expect plenty of tasty seafood from the river!

Conversely, one of the less popular times to visit is during the mist season, especially for Londoners—the weather is cold, grey, and humid. We recommend you consult a travel agent in your world to check when you would arrive; relativity between Fractures is much more pliable than you would expect.

Our calendar is as follows:

1. Ilubya
2. Aubirin
3. *Second Autumn month, unnamed*
4. Izio
5. Potalus
6. Volorak
7. *Mist month 1*
8. *Mist month 2*
9. *Prevernal 1*
10. Mola
11. Gandain
12. Laias


[^1]: Many people ask us why we call it a year, given that our Fracture is not a full planet and has no orbital period. When we explored the structure of our world, many scholars considered this question. We understand that the conditions for life lie in the [Nullspace](Nullspace.md) outsidie of our Fracture, giving us the same cycle as any planet. Back when we didn’t know any of this, we based our nomenclature on what we could observe: a repeating seasonal model. For a full explanation head to the University of Santarri’s public library.

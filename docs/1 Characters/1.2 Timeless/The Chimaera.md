# The Chimaera
> *Do not overcome the humility within,” the timeless overheard, just able to understand the tongue, “it is a good tool. Strife and greed will erode your morality, and such will be immutable. Be sure, be steady, and may you survive what is… beyond.”*

The Chimaera, formerly known as █████, is a Timeless [[Coraxi]] and Sage of [[Mutability]]. After watching his entire tribe killed at the hands of the [[Snowblood]], he was imprisoned; upon his reawakening into the forests surrounding the City, the Chimaera was approached by [[Revai, Fracture's Ward|Airve Snowblood]] to aid the [[Dragonkin]] in the [[War of Patrons]].

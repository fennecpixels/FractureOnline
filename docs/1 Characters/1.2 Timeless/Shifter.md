# Shifter
Shifter is a timeless derivative of [[Revai, Fracture's Ward|Airve]] formed during [[Fracture’s Timelines#Trueblue|Trueblue]]. Imbued with the power to cross timelines, they teach other versions of Airve how to manage their mutual power.

## Formation
Upon resurrection by [[Pakaru]], Shifter foresaw a temporal decay of Fracture—caused by their own revival. When this reached its apex, they managed to send Pakaru through *metatime*, the timeline of timelines. This was not the case for Shifter, whose body was destroyed. Their soul survived in a strange form of [[Nullspace]], where they eventually learned how to jump.

> [!warning]- A note on Shifter’s origins
> *The following is no longer canon to the story of Shifter, but kept here for archival reasons.*
> Shifter was the codename I originally gave Airve when he traversed the Abstract Plane and met the Origin! My inspiration came from *Into the Spider-Verse*: I wanted Airve to feel powerful again, to feel cool and dynamic—in the end, I went more superheroey than I wanted to, I think. Shifter nowadays is a very fun character to play with, as I’ve turned them into a harbinger: when they turn up, that AU is getting out of control. They’re definitely more mature, and I needed that in Fracture. Much better than a literal copy of the plot for *Into the Spider-Verse*!

## Helping Trueblue
After the death of [[Arnaud Oðrok|Adi]] in [[Fracture’s Timelines#Trueblue]], Shifter turned up to teach the prospective Airve how to combat [[Pakaru|Pakaru, the Third Nullspace Prince]]—he would have to learn through new timelines. This power led to the rise of [[Trueblue]] after Pakaru’s defeat.

## In the [[Timeless Castle]]
Shifter met Airve, the Timeless and warned him of his blinks—iterations of different ‘Airves’ to find an optimal pattern. Through their multiple consolation, they helped to resolve the stress that the Timeless carried. Eventually, they convinced the Timeless to rebirth himself as *Revai* whilst keeping the harder memories locked in the castle. Shifter promised to look after these and helped Revai in recovering anything of note.

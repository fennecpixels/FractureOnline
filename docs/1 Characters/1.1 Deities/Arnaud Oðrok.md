# Arnaud Oðrok
> *Healer, mindreader, barbarian: Arnaud holds the line between real and [[Irrealis]].*

Arnaud is the current guard of the [[Eternal Forge]], ruled by [[Aurin Swarf]], as well as the senior authority for the [[Orc|Orcs]].

Previously known as **Adi Snowblood**, Arnaud was husband to [[Revai, Fracture's Ward|Airve Snowblood]] before the [[War of Patrons]], which saw their mariage annuled due to Airve’s exile.

Arnaud used to be the wielder of the [[Mind Fragment]], a [[Fractured Remnants|Fractured Artefact]]. He first came into contact with the Artefact whilst foraging for metal on the Loheart estate—sediment from the Snowblood cavern. It was destroyed during the War of Patrons. 

During the war, Adi took the side of the Artefactborn. He promoted the democracy of the Sanctuary City, but disagreed with the exile of his husband. Nevertheless, he took care for Auburn, who suffered from an [[Irrealis]]-borne disease.

Whereas Auburn Loheart and Airve Snowblood were reborn into Aurin and Revai, Arnaud took his family’s original name, Oðrok. He continued to support Aurin as a guard and mentor who offered his healing to the pilgrims visiting the Eternal Forge.

# Aurin Swarf
> *Guardian of the [[Eternal Forge]], Aurin grants her visitors the gift of the flame - be that their bane or their ward.*

Aurin Swarf, previously known as Auburn Loheart, is the guardian of the Eternal Forge, where she offers the fire’s gambit. After falling ill from the effects of [[Irrealis]], she ascended from her previous life—though only stayed alive thanks to [[Arnaud Oðrok]].

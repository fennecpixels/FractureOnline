# Pakaru
* Pakaru is a Timeless [[Fractured Remnants|Fractured Artefact]] created during [[The Great Split]]. It is also a [[Nullspace#Nullspace Princes|Nullspace Prince]].
* Pakaru is both a deity and a material force: not only is it conscious and self-aware, but it is present within organic matter within Fracture. Pakaru represents the desire to survive—a catalyst necessary during the first [[10 Seconds]].
* Over multiple [[Fracture’s Timelines|timelines]] Pakaru has developed into a wiser creature. It has decided upon three “ages” which suit itself: 
	* *Young Pakaru*: the desire to hunt and overcome other life, this creature resurrected [[Dust]] as a warrior.
	* *Juvenile Pakaru:* in these timelines, Pakaru began to fuse with the *Thread Stone* (as previously known) and take on the roles of protector. This ultimately ended with the third [[Nullspace#Nullspace Prince|Nullspace Prince]] 
	* *Pakaru, bound*: present from [[Fracture’s Timelines#Newblue]] onward, this wissened creature knows the game of fracture better than anyone. It seeks a quieter life as the natural protector of organic life without the desires or violence of previous generations. Its protection of Dust is intrinsic.

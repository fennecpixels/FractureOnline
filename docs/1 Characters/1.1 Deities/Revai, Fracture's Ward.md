# Revai, Fracture's Ward
> *Once heir to the [Snowblood](Snowblood.md) Throne, Revai now governs the [Boundarywalkers](Boundarywalker) at [Boundary's Edge](Boundary's%20Edge).*

Revai, Fracture's Ward is a patron to the [Boundarywalkers](Boundarywalker) and sovereign of [Boundary's Edge](Boundary's%20Edge). Previously known as Airve Snowblood, he used to govern over [Santarri](Santarri.md) and the [Snowblood Sancturary](Snowblood%20Sancturary.md) until his ousting as leader during the [War of Patrons](War%20of%20Patrons.md).

Now reborn as Revai, the King leads the Boundarywalkers in intelligence operations, research about Irrealis and the nature of their existence, and as defenders of the [Coraxi](Coraxi) of Boundary’s Edge.

# History
## Under Snowblood Rule
Airve Snowblood was illegitimately born to [Bursea Snowblood](Bursea%20Snowblood.md) and [Aryn Snowblood](Aryn%20Snowblood.md). Aryn, a necromancer who studied traces of [Pakaru](Pakaru), reanimated a fox with whom she fell pregnant; Bursea, her brother, became known as her husband and she as his wife. The two concealed the details of their son’s birth, and instead decided to have children of their own. 

As a child, Airve was neglected by his parents, whose royal duties and disdain for him gave them little time to deal with him; instead, he was often cared for by the [Orc](Orc.md) guards. When his parents did have the time for him, Airve tended to prefer Aryn over Bursea, the latter of whom ignored his nephew as much as possible. 

Airve soon realised the truth of his birth and childhood just before he turned 20. Under [Snow Elf](Snow%20Elf.md) culture, he was still considered a child, but he began to sneak out of the castle and rebel; consequently, Bursea became more authoritarian. These conflicts escalated until Bursea killed his sister in anger, an act which prompted the duel between himself and Airve. Airve was the victor.

## A life post-regicide
Airve quickly left the [Snowblood Castle](Snowblood%20Castle.md) to work around the city where he met [Auburn Loheart](Aurin%20Swarf) and [Arnaud Snowblood](Arnaud%20O%C3%B0rok), the latter of whom had also seeked work since his freedom from the Snowblood slave trade. He was employed under the Loheart house, where he foraged for metal to feed the [Eternal Forge](Eternal%20Forge.md).  During this, he found the [The Binding Stone](The%20Binding%20Stone), and he immediately experienced a vision sent from [Quantum](Quantum). 

Quantum showed Airve the final fight of [Sæval Crasys](S%C3%A6val%20Crasys.md) through the legendary hero’s eyes and let him solve the calculations; in other words, Quantum demonstrated the power of the Binding Stone and proposed the trade of time. Airve would work for Quantum by guarding the Stone, and Quantum would give Airve all of time. Quantum also taught the elf how to use Binding—manipulation of time—to create wards, weapons, and walls. Airve would become a good warrior to protect the timeline from *Inconsistencies*: malevolent spirits that threatened the integrity of Fracture. 


## War against [Persuasion](Mauvaise.md)
## [War of Patrons](War%20of%20Patrons.md)
## Trapped in [Irrealis](Irrealis.md)
When London assimilated into Fracture, Dubois’ army trapped and killed Quantum in the city. Using his likeness, Dubois trapped Airve inside Irrealis.

During this time, Airve began to learn the truths of Irrealis slowly: he met the [Boundarywalkers](Boundarywalker), who showed him how to manifest a power out of Irrealis, without need of a patron; and he began to build the [Timeless Castle](Timeless%20Castle.md), which he used as a science lab to experiment with space-time. 

Airve’s introduction into multithreaded timelines led to his corruption and usage of the title ‘The Timeless’. He didn’t see himself as an innovator, but simply a survivor who wanted to return home. Through his knowledge of the realm, Airve created entirely new timelines to test his instinct: 
- “Asarek” was a snow elf with minimal Binding powers. They were told to try and find the Chimaera “using any means necessary”. This timeline’s multiple iterations led only to identity confusion.

- “Andraste”, the name of SBG2, was an experiment of personality. Failure.

Multiple experiments led to Airve finding a universe stuck in [The Great Split](The%20Great%20Split.md), where he forged his new power of the [Tempest](Tempest.md).



* Upon the return of [London](London.md), Dubois and his mercenaries used Irrealis to summon and kill Quantum, an act which resulted in Airve’s inprisonment.
* During this time, he communed with Irrealis and slowly built the [Timeless Castle](Timeless%20Castle.md), a memory bank where he experimented in various alternate universes. 
* Using an augmented knowledge of Irrealis, he found [The Great Split](The%20Great%20Split.md) in another universe and derived his own source of power from it.
* Eventually, [Shifter](Shifter) visited to stop the experiments.
* When the Timeless *did* leave the castle, he stored what he had learned within the castle. The being which left was not the same as the one who created the Bound King.

## Rebirth as Revai

# Personality
## As Airve
Airve saw himself as a hero.

## As Revai
Revai is tactical above all else. Whereas Airve combined politics and Binding, Revai leaves the two separate. He sees himself as a successor to the old elf, and tries to avoid making same mistakes that his former self made. Revai wants protection, and thus he tries to be the sharpest mind in the room when it comes to diplomacy; this is why his Boundarywalkers keep intelligence on various municipalities across fracture. 

Having spent time both Timeless and in Irrealis, Revai rarely interacts with the world in the way Airve would have; instead, he is almost otherworldly in nature, much to the mystery of guests at Boundary’s Edge. Though, considering the need for protection, not many do visit. Revai will rarely make a ‘public’ appearance, such as in Santarri, and prefers to communicate subtly. 

Most notably, Revai understands a lot more about the truth of his nature as Airve than he ever did before. He understands the threat of the Binding Stone, and so he spends a lot of his private work hiding the Bind and the Tempest from public hands—as a deity, this is his most infamous trait.

# Notable trophies
Revai holds many relics of the lives he’s led:
- **[Legacybane](Legacybane.md)**, a timeless dagger [taken from Bursea Snowblood](#Under%20Snowblood%20Rule.md).
- [The Binding Stone](The%20Binding%20Stone)
-

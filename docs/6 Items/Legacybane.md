Legacybane (previously known as *The Regis*) is a dagger owned by [Airve Snowblood](../1%20Sentient/1.2%20People/Airve%20Snowblood.md) inherited from the [Snowblood Empire](Snowblood%20Empire.md). 

## Formation

The Regis was formed shortly after the creation of the [Snowblood Kingdom](Snowblood%20Kingdom.md) as ceremonial betrothal gift between the [Snowblood](Snowblood.md) and [Avre](Avre.md) families, and therefore did not see much use during the reign of [Mekrati Snowblood](Mekrati%20Snowblood.md), herself a peaceful ruler. 

The dagger has a curved blade and oval crossguard. As an ornamental weapon, these both featured an engraving that resembled a swirling pattern seeded from the joining pin. The hilt, made from metal, had its grip dyed red—presumably to signal fertility, or death—and was embossed with a small drawing just below the guard. This brand described a premonition from [Eria Snowblood-Avre](Eria%20Snowblood-Avre.md) of “an elf, of infinite patience, risen to the winged truth of the sky”.  This message was also engraved into the weapon. Moreover, the blade was decorated with a mix of quartz and gold cuts, the former representing Snowblood and the latter Avre.

Centuries later, the Regis needed restoration. The blade became a weapon: its edge was sharpened, the curve redefined to be more ergonomic, and the jewels removed. Most notably of all, the brand was removed to make space for an inserted crystal—a large, oval cut of [Sel Sang](Sel%20Sang.md), the currently official stone to represent the Snowblood Kingdom. The weapon has not changed in form since then.

### Acquisition by [Airve](../1%20Sentient/1.2%20People/Airve%20Snowblood.md)
The Regis was passed down between each Snowblood generation until the reign of [Bursea Snowblood](Bursea%20Snowblood.md). He normally kept the weapon on him at all times, as was custom with each monarch, so that the Sel Sang would have its full effects. However, upon the eve of his death, the [Airve Snowblood](../1%20Sentient/1.2%20People/Airve%20Snowblood.md), his illegitimate son, took the blade and transformed it into a longer sword, augmented by a power yet unknown^[It is suspected that this was an effect of Airve’s later acquisition of [The Binding Stone](The%20Binding%20Stone.md), as the light refraction matches that of the Binding Stone. ]. It stayed within Bursea’s corpse until the formation of the [Snowblood Sancturary](Snowblood%20Sancturary.md), when Airve took the knife again and renamed it *Legacybane.*

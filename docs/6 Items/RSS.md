**Status: First Draft. Content is subject to change.**

**RSS** is an anomalous mechanical object unearthed near Northeastern Peak, $\mathbb{F}_{0}$. It is believed to be the product of a long-extinct civilisation. According to its internal data, it was a scientific instrument that monitored extra-terrestrial data; furthermore, it presumably outlived the original society that formed it. We do not know when it stopped functioning.

RSS is also an early link to [Irrealis](Irrealis.md), which suggests that the relatively new concept emerged significantly before current theories would otherwise dictate. If RSS can be verified as an authentic artefact, its discovery will have a large impact on our understanding of [Fracture](Fracture.md).

## Discovery and Initial Observations
RSS was discovered at the Northeastern Peak whilst a new construction project was underway. One local resident, who wishes to remain anonymous, differentiated its distinctive frame from other sherds and invited archaeologists to study it further. 

The authors would like to thank Northeastern Peak for its patience whilst we extracted the chassis and examined it.

Our initial analysis of RSS showed us that it had electronic components, but we required further examination to find it stored data, too. Similarly to our observations further on in this report, RSS’ computer architecture appeared incomprehensibly alien with the exception of a few ‘grafted’ USB ports—from which colleagues from New Tokyo were able to copy data. 

## Data Examination

We took great care to not short any electronics when copying data. Power was already supplied by the chassis itself—we did not wish to test the volatility of its storage and opted to comply with the circumstances handed to us.

The data stored on RSS, whilst largely inaccessible, clearly describes early accounts of a civilisation that precedes [The Great Split](The%20Great%20Split.md). Their early creation is most legible to computer parsing software and includes an epoch from which a basic chronology can be extrapolated.

RSS was created in order to monitor extra-terrestrial data. It is not clear whether it was *designed*, (i.e. by a more advanced society) or if it *emerged* as an evolved partition of something else. Its logs demonstrate that it tried to share information with other entities.[^1] On another note, these logs are incredibly numerous: this implies that either RSS and its contemporaries fulfilled their objective for a long period of time, and/or that there was a large magnitude of similar runtimes within the system.

Furthermore, we believe that RSS outlived the parent entity to which it transmitted data. The last few legible logs indicate a distinct shift in payload structure; the format appears to have sharply developed in ways we do not fully understand. After this point we are unable to translate further and must rely on an archaeological analysis of RSS’ chassis.

[^1]: Even if we cannot fully translate these logs right now, colleagues from New Tokyo have assured the rest of the research team that the pattern fits most computer networking theories.

## Physical dissemination

One of the first notable parts of RSS’ disassembly[^2] was the inclusion of [Irrealis](Irrealis.md) within its metallic frame. Though we could not manipulate it, the combination of electricity and Macrodesire is relatively novel—we believe this shows that the original society was incredibly technologically advanced. 

The object features only one ‘eye’ with multiple sensors and lenses collected within a unified ‘eyeball’. We could only discern that these included distance markers and a camera. The remaining architecture is unclear. However, it is worth noting that we measured a peak of Irrealis near these optics, whilst we measured the majority of power in its storage system. This could be a simple malfunctioning in old circuitry, but some colleagues believe this to be intentional: if such were the case, we must ask ourselves what RSS—or its creators—wish to preserve? Further examination of the data is necessary.

In terms of its chassis, we note a mixture of components with varied ages: the most centralised parts are oldest, with exception of the optics, whereas the limbs and exoskeleton are slightly more modern. There appears to be a shift in design philosophy with these new grafts: the ‘original’ parts are lightweight and sharply angular, whereas the extremities and optics have a more chaotic, randomised (almost desperate?) appearance. At some point, there must have been a shortage of key materials to reconstruct itself and rationing was necessary.

The most interesting part of its chassis is the blend of materials chosen. Material analysis indicates copper and iron alloys, ceramics, and silicone fragments—previously glass, perhaps. Whilst now unfortunately visually indiscernable, this is one of the larger components in our understanding of RSS’ original design.

Overall, a reconstruction of RSS to its previous state would present a bipedal robot. It appears to have been relatively low profile despite multiple inner chambers, the purposes of which are not clear. Its head structure follows this precise, angular style, perhaps with multiple motors for acute adjustment and control—we suspect this to be for adjusting light control, but given there are already lights within the chassis, it could also be vestigial biomimickry. 

[^2]: The authors would like to note that we did not fully disassemble RSS, nor permanently. We judged that it would not be viable for reactivation and mutually agreed to examine interior components.


## Significance

In conclusion, we believe the discovery of RSS to be one of the most influential finds in recent times. Its existence—if accurate to what we have discovered here—uncovers an entirely new era before The Great Split. We spoke to the [Coraxi](../5%20Species/Coraxi.md) about RSS, who hypothesised that their god, [Pakaru](../1%20Sentient/1.1%20Deities/Pakaru.md), would not have been aware of it or similar entities. We understand that, despite its dubious existence, the Coraxi’s god should have a recollection of any civilisations capable of creating such delicate machines. As such, it is clear that RSS predates all currently known societies and is worth further study.

**Addendum:** the authors would like to formally apologise to [Boundary’s Edge](Boundary%E2%80%99s%20Edge.md) for our descriptions of Coraxi culture and Pakaru.

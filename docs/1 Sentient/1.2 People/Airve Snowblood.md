Airve Snowblood, the Timeless was the wielder of [The Binding Stone](The%20Binding%20Stone.md) and the co-leader of the [Snowblood Sancturary](Snowblood%20Sancturary.md). After rebelling against the [Snowblood Empire](Snowblood%20Empire.md), he co-founded the Sanctuary with [Auburn Loheart](Aurin%20Swarf.md) and [Adi Snowblood](Arnaud%20O%C3%B0rok.md), with whom he worked until his ousting during the [War of Patrons](War%20of%20Patrons.md). Airve is recognised as the slayer of the Snowblood family; as Fracture’s Ward; and as a key aide in the revival of the [Coraxi](../../5%20Species/Coraxi.md) population. Airve Snowblood is assumed dead: he disappeared after a fight with [M. Dubois](M.%20Dubois.md), but no corpse was discovered. He was officially pardoned by the Santarri government after this attack and a statue erected in his honour.

## History
### Childhood

Airve was illegitimately conceived by [Aryn Snowblood](Aryn%20Snowblood.md), who inseminated herself with a reanimated fox as per her studies on necromancy. This scandalous act had to be covered up, and so she assumed the role of [Bursea Snowblood](Bursea%20Snowblood.md)’s wife. This relationship with her brother would go unnoticed, but the falsified dynamic between the two presented itself through neglect: Airve was largely raised by the guards and staff of the castle; once he was old enough to understand what was happening, he began to rebel against his artificial parents. They had had other children whom they used to falisfy the narrative—particularly that Airve should be heir de jure[^1].

[^1]: In Snowblood culture, the eldest child would be *heir de jure*, the most likely successor to the Monarch. The transfer of power would happen on two conditions: either the Monarch dies and therefore the *heir de jure* assumes power; or the Monarch is challenged whilst they are alive. Challenges are largely ceremonial and the *heir de facto* is the eldest child. However, if the two heirs are not the same, the Monarch will fight the *heir de facto*. On the occasion that this heir wins, power is transfered. 

Airve first became notable for challenging Bursea. The conflict, that lasted for three days, led to Aryn Snowblood’s death by hanging, enacted by her brother, Bursea’s own death, and the collapse of the Snowblood castle’s authority. Although his siblings[^2] tried to challenge him instantly, Airve would eventually force them out. He vowed to end the Snowblood empire from this point. In Santarri, this was already the case, and the town was no longer governed.

[^2]: Except for [Macabre Snowblood](Macabre%20Snowblood.md), the only one to support Airve, who had died a few weeks prior. She was the youngest. Some believe that seeing her ghost signals impending death.


### A life post-regicide
Airve quickly left the [Snowblood Castle](Snowblood%20Castle.md) to work around the city where he met [Auburn Loheart](Aurin%20Swarf.md) and [Arnaud Snowblood](Arnaud%20O%C3%B0rok.md), the latter of whom had also seeked work since his freedom from the Snowblood slave trade. He was employed under the Loheart house, where he foraged for metal to feed the [Eternal Forge](Eternal%20Forge.md).  During this, he found the [The Binding Stone](The%20Binding%20Stone.md), and he immediately experienced a vision sent from [Quantum](Quantum.md). 

Quantum showed Airve the final fight of [Sæval Crasys](S%C3%A6val%20Crasys.md) through the legendary hero’s eyes and let him solve the calculations; in other words, Quantum demonstrated the power of the Binding Stone and proposed the trade of time. Airve would work for Quantum by guarding the Stone, and Quantum would give Airve all of time. Quantum also taught the elf how to use Binding—manipulation of time—to create wards, weapons, and walls. Airve would become a good warrior to protect the timeline from *Inconsistencies*: malevolent spirits that threatened the integrity of Fracture. 


### War against [Persuasion](Mauvaise.md)
### [War of Patrons](War%20of%20Patrons.md)
### Trapped in [Irrealis](Irrealis.md)
When London assimilated into Fracture, Dubois’ army trapped and killed Quantum in the city. Using his likeness, Dubois trapped Airve inside Irrealis.

During this time, Airve began to learn the truths of Irrealis slowly: he met the [Boundarywalkers](Boundarywalker.md), who showed him how to manifest a power out of Irrealis, without need of a patron; and he began to build the [Timeless Castle](Timeless%20Castle.md), which he used as a science lab to experiment with space-time. 

Airve’s introduction into multithreaded timelines led to his corruption and usage of the title ‘The Timeless’. He didn’t see himself as an innovator, but simply a survivor who wanted to return home. Through his knowledge of the realm, Airve created entirely new timelines to test his instinct: 
- “Asarek” was a snow elf with minimal Binding powers. They were told to try and find the Chimaera “using any means necessary”. This timeline’s multiple iterations led only to identity confusion. 
> ![20220926 Asarek.png](../../20220926%20Asarek.png) 
- “Andraste”, the name of SBG2, was an experiment of personality. Failure.

Multiple experiments led to Airve finding a universe stuck in [The Great Split](The%20Great%20Split.md), where he forged his new power of the [Tempest](Tempest.md).



* Upon the return of [London](London.md), Dubois and his mercenaries used Irrealis to summon and kill Quantum, an act which resulted in Airve’s inprisonment.
* During this time, he communed with Irrealis and slowly built the [Timeless Castle](Timeless%20Castle.md), a memory bank where he experimented in various alternate universes. 
* Using an augmented knowledge of Irrealis, he found [The Great Split](The%20Great%20Split.md) in another universe and derived his own source of power from it.
* Eventually, [Shifter](Shifter.md) visited to stop the experiments.
* When the Timeless *did* leave the castle, he stored what he had learned within the castle. The being which left was not the same as the one who created the Bound King.
